# Face-Detection-using-OpenCV-Gradio
’m excited to share my latest computer vision project where I built a real-time face detection system using OpenCV Haar Cascade and deployed it with an interactive Gradio UI.

## ==> What this project does:
Detects human faces accurately from uploaded images
Uses Haar Cascade Classifier for efficient face detection
Provides an easy-to-use web interface with Gradio
Converts images between PIL and OpenCV formats for seamless processing

## ==> Tech Stack Used:
Python
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Gradio

## ==> Key Learnings & Challenges:
Handling image format conversions (PIL ↔ OpenCV)
Understanding Haar Cascade working principles
Solving dependency issues like ModuleNotFoundError: cv2
Optimizing detection accuracy while keeping execution fast

## ==> This project strengthened my understanding of computer vision pipelines, real-time image processing.
